to include any library related to new package just add it in 

include_directories("${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/include/General") in the file /home/sangeeta/ParMooN/ParMooN/CMakeLists.txt

I am defining all the cmake variables in cmake of parmoon but the issue is that it can't find the path to libraries for cmake of torch

After lunch resolve how to give the path of torchconfig.cmake
